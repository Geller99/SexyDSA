## Trees

 A node can only point to a child node and not anything sideways
    every node is moving away from the root node
    There must be one singular root node
    Root is the top node
    A child is a node directly connected to another node in the direction away from a tree
    Siblings - a group of nodes with the same parent
    Leaf -  a node with no children
    Edge -  connection between one node and another

    Tree is a recursive datastructure - arrangement is such that the root of the tree contains links to the root of all sub-trees
    Recursion means reducing something in a self-similar manner
    In a tree with n-nodes, there is exactly n-1 edges - one incoming node for each node except the root

    Depth and Height
    - Depth of X - length of the path from root to the node X
    - Height of X - number of edges in longest path from X to a leaf node
    - Height of Tree - height of root node
    
    Trees Classifications
    - Binary Tree: Nodes can only have two children


    Applications of Trees 
    - Naturally Heirarchical data: File and folder structures
    - Organize data: for quick search, insertion, deletion
    - Trie: dictionary, dynamic spell-checking
    - Network routing

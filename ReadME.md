## Data structures and Algorithms Grind


```
This is a short guide on data structures implemented in Javascript and C++

The goal is public accountability as I tackle these daily using ebooks and prepare for leetcoding rounds.

```

## Structure

```
Data structures will be covered using the OOP approach initially -  with automated tests written for each private class method

```

```
Custom Algorithms are built as we go - starting from the easy tiers (inbuilt methods) to the challenge tiers (Leetcode examples)

```

## Lodash  -- Hidash 

The hidash folder contains my attempts at lodash library internal methods to practice computational thinking and solving complexities

```
each implementation will have tests written for it as we go along

```
